# Class 7 Notes

1 - Domain Modeling is important because it allows us write code that matches our understanding of a problem, resuliting in code that's easier to understand, and allows us to group related information together so you know which variables belong to which problem.

1 - Layouts shouldn't be used for layouts unless you're the original Space Jam website. It's just an old way of structuring content that doesn't work as well in the era of responsive web design. Basically we have better tools now old man, get your table structure outta here.

2 - 1. The table tag creates our table, like ul/ol creates a list 2. The tr tag creates a row which holds our data 3. The td tag is like the li tag in the sense it populates a field in our row.

1 - Constructors are a way of creating objects outside of manually typing the object literal syntax. No more copy and pasting your methods!

2 - The `this` keyword refers to the current object it's in which is apparent when using it in an object literal. In the constructor function tho it is called into your created object and will then refer to whichever object you made using the `new` keyword.

1 - I don't understand this question well enough to answer it

## Things I want to know more about

Does the term inheritance apply to subclasses or prototypes or both?

Is there any downside to using the Class syntax?
