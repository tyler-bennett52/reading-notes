# Class 8 Notes

1 - Flexbox is one-dimensional in the sense that it wants to display it's content in a single row or column depending on how you set it. It is only when it runs out of space will it push things onto the cross axis, creating a 2nd dimension.

2 - The main axis is horizontal for rows and vertical for columns. The cross axis is perpendicular ot the main axis. Content runs along the main until it runs out of room, in which case it will create a new level of the main axis by traversing the cross axis.

3 - Flexbox will dynamically restructure your content in a way that might not align with the structure of your markup. This can be a problem if your markup is giving a structure to a screenreader that is no longer true.

1 - The advantage of flexbox over float is flexbox has more functionality and control attached to it than float, and that flexbox is much easier to make responsive than floats.

2 - I want to make cool things, and then I want to make those cool things beautiful so that they're even cooler. CSS is cool and people who are good at CSS are cool and I want to be cool so I want to be good at CSS so I want to be good at flexbox.
