# Class 12 Notes

1 = The canvas element allows you to draw in 2d. It's like paint but big complicated.

2 - If you don't close your canvas tag everything following it will only be displayed if your canvas element fails to load.

3 - Here's what the website says. You tell me what it means though, because this is straight nonsense to me.

    The getContext() takes one argument which is the type of context. For example, you use the "2d" to get a 2D rendering context object, which is an instance of the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface.

1 - Chart.js is a library for data visualization. You can bring it in to your file with a cdn link.

2 - Without looking I'm going to say you can do Bar, Line, and Pie charts. If that isn't true then we should probably not be using charts.js.

1 - People skip over tables. I skip over tables. People like big colorful data rather than small boring text.

2 - Salmon Cookies could have used a chart, but to be honest it was such an inconsistent dataset (Seattle did way more volume than everybody else) it really was better represented in a table.

## Things I want to know more about

Is there somewhere that aggregates popular JS libraries. Like a vanilla JS npm?

Is there any downside to bringing in functionality via a cdn? Specifically I'm thinking about performance and load times.
