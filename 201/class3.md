# Class 3 Notes - Where There's a Will There's Array

1 - Unordered lists should be used for things like navlinks where they don't have precedence over each other

2 - Bullet style can be changed with the list-style-type property in CSS

3 - Ordered lists should be used for ranking/first-this-then-that styles and unordered should be used for less structured, but still related content

4 - You can change the list items in an ol to roman numerals or alphabetical

1 - Imagine you are a king/queen defending your castle. You station some troops outside your castle walls to protect the gate. These troops are the Margin Brigade. Inside the castle walls we station additional troops to shield our dear leader from any harm. This unit is the Padding Brigade. Our ruler in this case would be our content and the castle walls would be the border

2 - Box Model: 1. Margin 2. Border 3. Padding 4. Content

1 - You can store all sorts of stuff in an array. Simple stuff like numbers and strings, but also you can nest arrays in arrays in arrays and then inside of that array put an object that stores strings and functions and bools. Anyway the point is you can do almost anything

2 - Totally valid and cool array. To access the values in a nested array you can stack brackets like this `people[1][0]`

3 - Shorthand operators: 1. ++ increment by one 2. -- decrement by one 3. += increment by set value 4. -= decrement by set value 5. *= mulitply by set value

4 - The listed expression results in a NaN type because it does math stuff across mulitple data types which is like not super possible

5 - A conditional could be used to check for invalid input types in a password field and remind the user to read the instructions

6 - Loops could be useful to prompt a user until they give you a valid input
