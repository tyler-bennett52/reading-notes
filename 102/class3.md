# Class 3 Notes - Revisions and the Cloud

The value of version control and keeping backups of your work is obvious to me, as I make so many mistakes. De-risking code changes with version control seems to allow for a more adventurous mindset, and hopefully creates an environment where taking initiative on a project doesn't mean permanently altering other's work.

The two things I most want to remember about this section is the cloning process and the acp acronym. Cloning is moving your project from GitHub to your local storage and is done with the `git clone` command. Acp is an acronym for add, commit, push which correspond to the commands `git add .`  `git commit -m`  `git push origin main`

## Things I want to know more about

What is origin main and can I push to something other than that?

How do I pull an old version if I've made a mistake?

What are the pain points of working with a team in git?

How can I control who has access to push to my repositories?
