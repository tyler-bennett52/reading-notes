# Class 7 Notes - Control Flow and Operators

## Control Flow

Control flow is the order that a computer runs items in a script. The default behavior is just like humans - top to bottom. We can change that behavior by adding conditional statements and loops. We can create conditional statements with the `if` `else if` and `else` commands. That part of the script will only be executed if our condition is met, changing the control flow.

## Operators

Operators are used to manipulate data in a specific way. Numbers can be added or strings merged with the + sign, for example. Most of these are self-explanatory so I will just list some below:

        * Multiplication
        ** Exponentiation
        - Subtraction
        / Division
        % Modulo (find remainder of)

## Things I want to know more about

Is the Modulo operator used for much besides determining even/odd?

Where does Modulo fall into the PEMDAS model?

What happens when doing dumb things like dividing by 0?
