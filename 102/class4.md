# Class 4 Notes = Wireframes and HTML

## Wireframes

---
Wireframes are like a blueprint for a webpage. Before you start building you should make sure the ideas you have make sense by creating a rough draft and then use that going forward. This is also a good time to assign semantic HTML tags so you aren't tempted to div your way through once building.

## HTML

 ---
 If a wireframe is a blueprint then HTML elements are you building blocks. HTML is used to create the general structure of a webpage, without much styling or functionality that will be added at a later stage (like how you must lay a foundation before wiring a home for power).

## Things I want to know more about

How concerned should I be with structuring my content in HTML, knowing that I will be using CSS to restructure it?

How to decide between a class attribute and an ID attribute or both?
