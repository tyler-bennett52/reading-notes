## What is a Growth Mindset?

Was Jack Nicklaus one of the great golfers of his time because of a god-given ability, or was it a product of many *hundreds of hours of practice* in the wind and rain?
Believing it was a pre-determined ability is a **Fixed Mindset**, while believing he created those abilities through hard work and repetition is a **Growth Mindset**.

### 3 ways I stay in a growth mindset

1. Embrace failure, as it usually precedes progress
2. Measure time spent improving/practicing, not just results
3. Enjoy the little wins because it means the process is working and that I must KEEP GOING
