# Class 5 Notes - Cascading Swag Sheets

CSS is used to make your site beatiful. Changing colors, placements, decorations, margins, padding it's all done with CSS. Css is brought into your HTML file with a link tag like this.

 `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`

Now you can leave your markup alone and get to work in the linked css file (style.css in this case). Below is an example of CSS syntax. 

        h1 {

        color: #457b9d;

        text-decoration: wavy;

        }

The basic idea is that you select an element (h1 is selected above) then place your styling inside of curly braces. Then the format is 

`styling-type: specific-style;`

Don't bother memorizing all the stylings. Just use [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS) to find what you need.

## Things I want to know more about:

What are the limitations of CSS that drive people to use frameworks?

When should you use flexbox vs. grid?

Why do people use CSS resets?
