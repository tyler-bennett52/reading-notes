# Class 6 Notes - Javascript Don't Care

###### (but we care about Javascript)


Javascript makes our pages more interactive, interesting and functional. It allows us collect information, manipulate it, and present something useful to the end users. Creating a variable is done with the commmands `let`  `const` and `var`. Variable should not start with a number, contain spaces, and generally should use camelCase when using Javascript. An example of declaring a variable is below.

        let itBeKnown = "I am very cool";

        const able = "Bob";

        var iety = "is the spice of life";

But other than making bad jokes we can also use variable to collect data directly from users. We can use the `prompt()` command to solicit a string and `confirm` to get a return of either `true` or `false`. Below is an example of some variables we might set using those commands.

        const name = prompt("Hi! What's your name?");

        const isAllowedToDrink = confirm("Are you at least 21 years old?");

## Things I want to know more about

Why would we ever want to declare an unchangable variable, especially considering I would be the one trying to change it anyway?
