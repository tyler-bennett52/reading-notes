# Class 1 Notes - Markdown
---
Since we're going to be working with GitHub and GitHub uses Markdown, its important to get a handle on Markdown early so I can focus on *doing my work* and not get bogged down with details - like how to format it. Below I've put some of the more common Markdown styles and how to display them.

A good example of why its worth the time to learn Mardown is Reddit. The poor formatting of many posts on Reddit is the only reason I know what TL;DR means, but taking just a little bit of time to format your content makes all the difference to potential readers.

## Things I want to know more about

Today I tried adding an HTML body tag with some inline styling (background-color) on this page to protect my reader's precious eyeballs (remember that person grading this). But it blew up all of my Markdown formatting forcing me to get rid of it. So what I want to learn more about is the interaction between Markdown and HTML so that I can go back and forth between the two without messing anything up.
