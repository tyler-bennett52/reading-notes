Class 11 Notes

1 - Audio and Video on the web in the last twenty years has changed alot, primarily due to increased bandwidth. Images and video are much more prevalent on today's web than they used to because there isn't a dial-up connection holding anyone back anymore.

2 - `src` works the same in the video element as it does the img element. It provides a path to the relevant video file. The controls attribute gives the browser's video UI to your embedded video. Otherwise there wouldn't be a way for users to stop or restart the video.

3 - Not every browser will support every video file. For any browswer that slips through the cracks we leave a fallback option to display something explaining what's supposed to be there, or leaving a link the video file.

4 - One fish two fish, mp3 fish mp4 fish.

1 - Grid differs from Flex because it more easily incorporates a 2nd dimension (whereas Flex wants to work only on it's main axis).

2 - Grid container is the element we're going to divide into columns. Grid items are the elements that are divided up into the different grid areas. Grid lines mark the divisions you've made between rows/columns.

1 - Aside from looking better, responsive images can be a better fit for the bandwidth of a mobile device and by cropping images can allow users to focus more on the parts of the image you wanted them to see in the first place.

2 - srcset and sizes are like CSS media queries. srcset gives the browser multiple options for photos to display, and sizes directs the browser to display one over the other based on screen size.

3 - Honestly it just seems better to me because I can offload some complexity from my already messy CSS and JS files and push them over to my relatively tame HTML.

## Things I want to know more about

1 - Can we specify a certain video resolution by default?

2 - Is it common to build your own video controls or is it almost always handled by the browser?
