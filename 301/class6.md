# Class 6 Notes

1 - An object is like a locker and key combo. Each locker has a unique ID and holds almost anything you want. Lockers are often in rows together but the order is unimportant.

2 - Using the object literal allows you to group and label related information that do not share many similarties. For example you could use an object to group a persons contact information where each piece of info does not look the same as the last (e.g. email vs phone number).

3 - Well first of all arrays are objects so this question is funny. Secondly arrays have preassigned keys(?) that we know as indices. An array of `[a, b, c]` could be displayed like this:

    {
      0: a,
      1: b,
      2: c
    }

4 - Bracket notation is necessary when using a variable to access an object rather than the key name itself.

5 - this refers to the object that this is inside of. this is a useful keyword because it can be used when creating a template that creates multiple obeccts.

1 - The DOM is yet another object in Javascript (ObjectScript?) that stores useful data about your HTML/CSS so it can be altered on the fly.

2 - The DOM is a JS representation of HTML/CSS that JS alters to introduce interactivity onto a webpage.

## Things I would like to know more about

Is everything in JS an object?

Is all the world an object? Am I an object? What are my properties? Methods?

Is there ever an appropiate time to use the window object or is that just for behind the scenes stuff?
