# Class 5 Notes

1 - Including the alt attribute can help with accessibilty

2 - Similar to the last question, including the alt tag gives a screenreader something to say about an image

3 - Figures are great for putting a photo and caption in the same content box

4 - A gif is a moving picture(?)/short clip style while an SVG is a scalable icon supported by most browsers

5 - I woul use a PNG for a screenshot as they are the most lossless (also the default screenshot format on my system)

1 - Background-color is the landscape of a painting, while the color property is the focus of the painting

2 - I think using a few, bright colors against a healthy amount of either white or black really makes certain elements pop

3 - Not all fonts are supported by all browsers/operating systems. Consider loading in a google font onto your webpage

4 - Font-size makes text big/small, font-weight makes text skinny/bold, font-style is mostly good for italics

5 - To add spacing between the characters you can use either word-spacing or letter-spacing.

## Things I want to know more about

Are fonts becoming more universally available over time?

What happens when specifiying a font not available on a device?
